DEFECTS REALTING TO THIS SYSTEM...

If you enter a temperature that it has to heat or cool to. Then while it is performing heating
or cooling periods you attempt to put the system in sleep mode with another command, or enter 
another temperature. It will put it in sleep mode and update the temperature, but there is a chance
that the command you enter following the end of this period will get ignored. And you will have to enter
it again one or two times.

The specificaitons note that we should wait for the end of the current heating or cooling period 
before entering sleep mode or updating the goal temperature. This is not implemented. 

If you enter a command that is invalid, sometimes, the program will ignore your next input or your
next two inputs.
